**No-root network monitor, firewall and PCAP dumper**

PCAPdroid is a privacy-friendly open source app which lets you track, analyze and block the connections made by the other apps in your device. It also allows you to export a PCAP dump of the traffic, inspect HTTP, decrypt TLS traffic and much more!

PCAPdroid simulates a VPN in order to capture the network traffic without root. It does not use a remote VPN server, instead data is processed locally on the device.

Features:
- Log and examine the connections made by user and system apps
- Extract the SNI, DNS query, HTTP URL and the remote IP address
- Inspect HTTP requests and replies thanks to the built-in decoders
- Inspect the full connections payload as hexdump/text
- [Decrypt the HTTPS/TLS traffic](https://emanuele-f.github.io/PCAPdroid/tls_decryption) and export the SSLKEYLOGFILE
- Dump the traffic to a PCAP file, download it from a browser, or stream it to a remote receiver for real-time analysis (e.g. Wireshark)
- Create rules to filter out the good traffic and easily spot anomalies
- Identify the country and ASN of remote server via offline DB lookups
- On rooted devices, capture the traffic while other VPN apps are running

Paid features:

- [Firewall](https://emanuele-f.github.io/PCAPdroid/paid_features#51-firewall): create rules to block individual apps, domains and IP addresses
- [Malware detection](https://emanuele-f.github.io/PCAPdroid/paid_features#52-malware-detection): detect malicious connections by using third-party blacklists

## 7. LADB

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tytydraco/LADB/refs/heads/main/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png)

**local ADB shell**

LADB bundles an ADB server within the app libraries. Normally, this server cannot connect to the local device because it requires an active USB connection. However, Android's Wireless ADB Debugging feature allows the server and the client to speak to each other locally.

Initial Setup
Use split-screen more or a pop-out window with LADB and Settings at the same time. This is because Android will invalidate the pairing information if the dialog gets dismissed. Add a Wireless Debugging connection, and copy the pairing code and port into LADB. Keep both windows open until the Settings dialog dismisses itself.
